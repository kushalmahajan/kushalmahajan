### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Talk to me about front-end engineering - Architecting WebApps, Performance. I can detail about Data Structures and Algorithms | Javascript | ReactJs | NodeJs | DevOps | Server Driven ( SaaS based User flows) over a coffee or while sleeping. I can reason about less sensible UX design flows and over-engineered code, less attendant UI clunkiness.
