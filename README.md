### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Talk to me about front-end engineering - Architecting WebApps, Performance. I can detail about Data Structures and Algorithms | Javascript | ReactJs | NodeJs | DevOps | Server Driven ( SaaS based User flows) over a coffee or while sleeping. I can reason about less sensible UX design flows and over-engineered code, less attendant UI clunkiness.
I would like to contribute my free time building scalable solutions in backend tech stack to help me grow beyond Web Development. Reach out to utilise great product engineer for free after September 2020.
